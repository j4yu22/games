goal: create a python program that will be able to be fed an image
of a nightreign map, and create an optimal route for the user

features:
map reader - a class that will be able to parse the image and match
it to a seed as recorded in the google sheet

pathing algorithm - an algorithm that will help the user gain as
many runes/passive drops as possible in as short of an amount of time
as possible. it should prioritize POIs according to relevance in power
gain, and time to complete. some POIs should only be done after a
certain level, like storm POIs, red eyed field bosses, and castle
rooftop

path display - some way of displaying the ideal path a user should
take, most likely a path overlayed over a screen shot of their map
after they began their run, but for now just a path overlayed over
the initial image fed to the program would work

General strategy:
start
    get level 2, either by a camp, or nearby cathedral or fort
    
    clear an evergaol, take runes for level 4

pre close 1
    continue clearing as many evergaols, churches, mage towers (only
    if recluse or caster duchess in team), and 1 mine
    
    camps that align with boss weakness are best done on this day 

post close 1
    any pre close 1 POIs that are within circle

    scout castle, do castle basement if there is time

night 1
    do 1 POI, or non red eyed field boss as circle closes

pre close 2
    100% castle
    
    shifting earth

    any POIs from the opposite side of what was done previously (if top
    was done day 1, do bottom, if bottom was done day 1, do top)

    any red eyed field bosses along the way

    storm POIs

post close 2
    complete shifting earth

    any POIs from day 2, mainly evergaols and red eyed field bosses

night 2
    anything that will get runes on the way to final circle

    if already level 15, there is no need to risk death to storm here

Timeline:
    time till first circle beings to close - 270 sec 
    time till first circle finishes closing - 180 sec  
    time till second circle begins to close - 210 sec 
    time till second circle finishes closing - 180 sec  

    total time per day (excluding any boss fights) - 840 sec (14 min)

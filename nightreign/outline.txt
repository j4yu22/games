goal: create a python program that will be able to be fed an image
of a nightreign map, and create an optimal route for the user

features:
map reader - a class that will be able to parse the image and match
it to a seed as recorded in the google sheet

pathing algorithm - an algorithm that will help the user gain as
many runes/passive drops as possible in as short of an amount of time
as possible. it should prioritize POIs according to relevance in power
gain, and time to complete. some POIs should only be done after a
certain level, like storm POIs, red eyed field bosses, and castle
rooftop

path display - some way of displaying the ideal path a user should
take, most likely a path overlayed over a screen shot of their map
after they began their run, but for now just a path overlayed over
the initial image fed to the program would work

General strategy:
start
    get level 2, either by a camp, or nearby cathedral or fort
    
    clear an evergaol, take runes for level 4

pre close 1
    continue clearing as many evergaols, churches, mage towers (only
    if recluse or caster duchess in team), and 1 mine
    
    camps that align with boss weakness are best done on this day 

post close 1
    any pre close 1 POIs that are within circle

    scout castle, do castle basement if there is time

night 1
    do 1 POI, or non red eyed field boss as circle closes

pre close 2
    100% castle
    
    shifting earth

    any POIs from the opposite side of what was done previously (if top
    was done day 1, do bottom, if bottom was done day 1, do top)

    any red eyed field bosses along the way

    storm POIs

post close 2
    complete shifting earth

    any POIs from day 2, mainly evergaols and red eyed field bosses

night 2
    anything that will get runes on the way to final circle

    if already level 15, there is no need to risk death to storm here

Timeline:
    time till first circle beings to close - 270 sec 
    time till first circle finishes closing - 180 sec  
    time till second circle begins to close - 210 sec 
    time till second circle finishes closing - 180 sec  

    total time per day (excluding any boss fights) - 840 sec (14 min)

Algorithm Planning:
    things to consider while planning a route:
        start
        end
        priority POIs
        distance between objectives
        outer first, inner last

    optimal start from each spawn (assuming 3 stonesword keys in a team):
        1: level 2 from starting camp; A2 evergaol; clear topside
        2: level 2 from starting camp; C3 evergaol; clear topside
        3: level 2 from starting camp; D1 evergaol; clear topside
        4: level 2 from starting camp; F2 camp if present; E2 evergaol; clear topside
        5: level 2 from starting camp; E2 evergaol; clear topside
        6: circle dependent
            - if topside closing circle:
                get level 2 from B3 POI; clear topside
            - if bottomside closing circle:
                clear either b4 or b5 (whichever is likely to give stonesword); clear B5 evergaol; clear bottomside
        7: level 2 from E5 POI; E6 evergaol
        8: level 2 from starting camp; F3 evergaol
        9: level 2 from B5 POI; B5 evergaol
        10: level 2 from starting camp; D5 mine; E6 evergaol
        11: level 2 from starting camp; E6 evergaol

    regardless of where circle will close it seems like the start of a run (up to level 4)
    is always the same, with the exception of start 6. the players should always take runes
    for the first evergaol they clear. when they do they will be level 4. level 4 makes 
    everything other than storm POIs and red eyed bosses doable. castle contents and basement
    are an option here, but generally castle can be done late day 1, or early day 2. the 
    exception to this is if castle basement has the bell bearing hunter, in which case it must
    either be done day 2 or skipped entirely (probably the latter).

    to determine optimal pathing post level 4, players should navigate towards the night 1 end
    prioritizing the outer points. generally it seems like the same optimal 'micro routes' can be used,
    but they should be modified to accomodate stonesword key sources. generally knowing which side of
    the map the night 1 circle will close on will determine which of these micro routes will be effective.

    for maximum efficiency castle should be 100% completed day 2, so that the player doesn't need
    to route through the castle twice. the exception to this is if crucible knights are present,
    in which case going there right after level 4 would instantly power level the player to 
    breeze through any red eyed field bosses, strong evergaols, storm POIs, or any other difficult
    content in the game.

    micro routes can be done forwards or backwards, but here are a few:
        bottom side from left (reversable from right side, but castle is the only option afterwards):
            B5 evergaol
            C5 field boss
            C5 church / sorcerer's rise (if caster)
            D5 mine all the way through
            E6 evergaol
            castle/tree to E2/tree to B2
        
        topside from right (reversable from top left side as well):
            E2 evergaol
            E2 mine all the way through
            D1 church / sorcerer's rise (if caster)
            D1 evergaol
            C2 field boss
            C3 evergaol
            C3 church / sorcerer's rise (if caster)
            castle

        topside from top (possible with B1 tree and start 3, likely not reversable):
            D1 evergaol
            D2 mine
            E2 evergaol
            E2 church / sorcerer's rise
            D3 field boss
            C2 field boss
            C3 evergaol
            C3 church / sorcerer's rise (if caster)
            castle

    any POIs that are within 1 grid square and that are along the flow of the path
    that have a high likelyhood of a stonesword key should be included either before
    or after these micro routes, but not during as they are about as efficient as it
    gets, and they involve evergaols that are near the border of the map.

    stonesword key probable locations are completely irrelevant if township is
    on the map, because each teammate can buy a stonesword key for an additional
    3 keys, making a total of 6
